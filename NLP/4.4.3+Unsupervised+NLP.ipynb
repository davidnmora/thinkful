    "After cleaning and ignoring stop words, we use tf-idf to identify words that are particular or significant within a small number of sentences. \"The tf_idf score will be highest for a term that occurs a lot within a small number of sentences, and lowest for a word that occurs in most or all sentences\". Then make each word a one hot encoded dimension for each paragraph (document). \n",

    "Solution to both issues? Shrink it down with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which like PCA but not mean-centered, which tries to colapse similar words into single components. **For example, maybe \"Emma\" and \"smart\" appear often together, so those could be collapsed into a single component (right?)** \"What we get, in the end, is clusters of terms that presumably reflect a topic,\" with each paragraph (document) scored on each topic.\n",

       " 'Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty - one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .',\n",
       " \"She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .\",\n",
       " \"Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma .\",\n",
       " \"The real evils , indeed , of Emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments .\",\n",
       " 'Sorrow came  a gentle sorrow  but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness . Miss Taylor married .',\n",
       " 'The event had every promise of happiness for her friend .',\n",
       " 'How was she to bear the change ?  It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .',\n",
       " 'The evil of the actual disparity in their ages ( and Mr . Woodhouse had not married early ) was much increased by his constitution and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his life , without activity of mind or body , he was a much older man in ways than in years ; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not have recommended him at any time .',\n",
       " 'Her sister , though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled in London , only sixteen miles off , was much beyond her daily reach ; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield , before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband , and their little children , to fill the house , and give her pleasant society again .',\n",
       " 'Highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which Hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals .',\n",
       " '\" Poor Miss Taylor !  I wish she were here again .',\n",
       " '\" I can not agree with you , papa ; you know I can not .',\n",
       " '\" A house of her own !  But where is the advantage of a house of her own ?',\n",
       " '\" How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us !  We shall be always meeting !',\n",
       " '\" My dear , how am I to get so far ?',\n",
       " '\" No , papa , nobody thought of your walking .',\n",
       " '\" The carriage !',\n",
       " '\" They are to be put into Mr . Weston \\' s stable , papa .',\n",
       " '\" I am very glad I did think of her .',\n",
       " 'Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own .',\n",
       " \"Mr . Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella ' s husband .\",\n",
       " '\" Not at all , sir .',\n",
       " '\" But you must have found it very damp and dirty .',\n",
       " '\" Dirty , sir !',\n",
       " '\" Well !',\n",
       " '\" By the bye  I have not wished you joy .',\n",

       " '\" Especially when _ one _ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature ! \"',\n",
       " '\" I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed , \" said Mr . Woodhouse , with a sigh .',\n",
       " '\" My dearest papa !',\n",
       " 'Mr . Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body .',\n",
       " '\" Emma knows I never flatter her , \" said Mr . Knightley , \" but I meant no reflection on any body .',\n",
       " '\" Well , \" said Emma , willing to let it pass  \" you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly .',\n",
       " '\" Dear Emma bears every thing so well , \" said her father .',\n",
       " 'Emma turned away her head , divided between tears and smiles .',\n",
       " '\" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me , \" said Emma , \" and a very considerable one  that I made the match myself .',\n",
       " 'Mr . Knightley shook his head at her .',\n",
       " '\" I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people .',\n",
       " '\" Ever since the day  about four years ago  that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell \\' s , I made up my mind on the subject .',\n",
       " '\" I do not understand what you mean by ` success , \\' \" said Mr . Knightley .',\n",
       " '\" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?  I pity you . I thought you cleverer  for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .',\n",
       " '\" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns .',\n",
       " '\" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others , \" rejoined Mr . Woodhouse , understanding but in part .',\n",
       " '\" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr . Elton .',\n",
       " '\" Mr . Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him .',\n",
       " '\" With a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time , \" said Mr . Knightley , laughing , \" and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing .',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER II',\n",
       " 'Mr . Weston was a native of Highbury , and born of a respectable family , which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property .',\n",
       " 'Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend .',\n",
       " 'Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune  though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate  was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .',\n",
       " \"Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .\",\n",
       " 'A complete change of life became desirable .',\n",
       " 'It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .',\n",
       " \"He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ' s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age .\",\n",
       " 'Mr . Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .',\n",
       " \"Now , upon his father ' s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place .\",\n",
       " 'It was , indeed , a highly prized letter .',\n",
       " \"She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations .\",\n",
       " \"Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs . Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction  her more than satisfaction  her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor , ' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .\",\n",
       " 'There was no recovering Miss Taylor  nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr . Woodhouse .',\n",
       " \"There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs . Weston ' s wedding - cake in their hands : but Mr . Woodhouse would never believe it .\",\n",
       " 'CHAPTER III',\n",
       " 'Mr . Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way .',\n",
       " \"Real , long - standing regard brought the Westons and Mr . Knightley ; and by Mr . Elton , a young man living alone without liking it , the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr . Woodhouse ' s drawing - room , and the smiles of his lovely daughter , was in no danger of being thrown away .\",\n",
       " 'After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs . and Miss Bates , and Mrs . Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr . Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Bates , the widow of a former vicar of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Goddard was the mistress of a School  not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems  and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity  but a real , honest , old - fashioned Boarding - school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies .',\n",
       " \"These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father ' s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs . Weston .\",\n",
       " 'As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs . Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty .',\n",
       " 'Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody .',\n",
       " 'She was a very pretty girl , and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired .',\n",
       " \"She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging  not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk  and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .\",\n",
       " 'She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes , in talking and listening , and forming all these schemes in the in - betweens , that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate ; and the supper - table , which always closed such parties , and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time , was all set out and ready , and moved forwards to the fire , before she was aware .',\n",
       " 'Upon such occasions poor Mr . Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare .',\n",
       " 'Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say :',\n",
       " '\" Mrs . Bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs .',\n",
       " 'Emma allowed her father to talk  but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy .',\n",
       " 'CHAPTER IV',\n",
       " \"Harriet Smith ' s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing .\",\n",
       " 'Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to .',\n",
       " 'Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but Harriet could not tell .',\n",
       " 'Mrs . Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation  and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey - Mill Farm , it must have been the whole .',\n",
       " 'For some time she was amused , without thinking beyond the immediate cause ; but as she came to understand the family better , other feelings arose .',\n",
       " 'With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr . Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .',\n",
       " '\" Well done , Mrs .',\n",
       " '\" And when she had come away , Mrs . Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs . Goddard a beautiful goose  the finest goose Mrs . Goddard had ever seen .',\n",
       " '\" Mr . Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ?',\n",
       " 'The next question was ',\n",
       " '\" What sort of looking man is Mr .',\n",
       " '\" That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name .',\n",
       " '\" To be sure .',\n",
       " '\" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man .',\n",
       " '\" He was four - and - twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day \\' s difference  which is very odd . \"',\n",
