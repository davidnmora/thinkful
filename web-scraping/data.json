When I found out that a number of women had been attacked via the local newspaper , but worried women in my area seemed to be uninformed, I took matters into my own hands and contacted the local press (Nottingham Evening Post) anonymously, telling them that I wanted them to run my story, in the hope of raising awareness. I wish I hadn\u2019t. First of all, they clearly had no concern for my own safety, wishing to print a photo of me on the front page. When I said they could photograph me from the back only, then they took me to the place where I had been assaulted \u2013 which was of course traumatic \u2013 and took a photo of me from behind.

They also changed my age to make me younger than I am, supposedly because this gives them a \u2018sexier\u2019 sexual assault. They ignored the details of how I had fought back and even chased after my attacker, trying to punch him to the ground and keep him there until someone could come and help.

The female journalist on the phone gave me a \u2018girl power\u2019 type speech about how I\u2019d be helping other women to convince me to do it, but they repeated the same kind of reporting style as before, all sinister horror movie details and ignoring the practical advice I gave about carrying a rape alarm, taking self-defence classes etc.", "I am writing this to warn women now, not to ever speak to the press if they have been the victims of a sexual attack unless they are absolutely sure of what the journalist will print and have a power to veto.
