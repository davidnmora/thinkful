Everyone from family, to colleagues to literal strangers feel comfortable telling me this/making this assumption. Once, when talking to my mother, she told me I was only queer because of \u201cthat boyfriend who gave you HPV.\u201d I honestly stopped trying with family regardless of sexuality because they insist my queerness is due to abuse. It\u2019s perplexing, as most of them have experienced sexual trauma and/or been raised with single moms \u2013 and yet all but a few of us are straight. I\u2019ve gotten apologies for not protecting me from some sexual abuse they\u2019ve invented, but never apologies for voting for legislation limiting my rights as a queer parent. It\u2019s just so strange! Even in my same-gender loving life, I am measured by the actions of men. It can\u2019t possibly be that I am really, really attracted to and deeply in love with women lol."], "tags": ["Home", "Media", "Public space", "School", "University", "Workplace"]},

There was a student working part-time in the same lab who was getting his bachelor\u2019s.  After over a year on contract, he finished his degree and we were both up for two different internal full-time salaried positions.  I went through a lengthy interview process and had to compete with many experienced out side candidates.  He was immediately offered a job, even though both of the full-time positions had a similar start date.  After I accepted my job offer, I found out that his starting wage was 35% higher than mine even though I had been in a senior position and managing his work load since I started.  And FYI this was a major Fortune 500 company in 2007."], "tags": ["Workplace"]},

I told him I thought that was incredibly offensive and patronizing.  Radio silence for 15 minutes and he came back and said \u201cI will deal with that.\u201d  Maybe he did, I don\u2019t know.

I immediately reacted and he said that it was \u201can accident\u201d. For a moment I tried to think of what I could have done to make him think it was okay for him to touch me without my consent.
